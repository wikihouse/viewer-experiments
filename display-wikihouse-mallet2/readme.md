### Build Series
The 'Build' series of files may grow into the specialty of creating new objects that are forks/clones/mini-me's
of the equivalent WikiHouse object directly from user input.

[Build WikiHouse Mallet2 R3]( http://wikihouse.github.io/viewer-experiments/display-wikihouse-mallet2/build-wikihouse-mallet2-r3.html )

* 2015-05-10 ~ 5 sliders added
* Simplification and code clean-up


[Build WikiHouse Mallet2 R2]( http://wikihouse.github.io/viewer-experiments/display-wikihouse-mallet2/build-wikihouse-mallet2-r2.html )

* 2015-05-05 ~ Just about completely parameterized
* Can use simplification and code clean-up

[Build WikiHouse Mallet2 R1]( http://wikihouse.github.io/viewer-experiments/display-wikihouse-mallet2/build-wikihouse-mallet2-r1.html )

* 2015-05-04 ~ Work-in-progress toward parameterization
* Building the mallet from a list of vertices for each component

### Display Series
The 'Display' series of files appear to be growing into the specialty of extracting data and measuring data in a variety of manners
 from the WikiHouse DXF files. Once gathered the data may be used to help with creating parameterized scripts

* 2015-05-03 ~ This demo loads an AutoCAD 2007 formatted DXF files and displays the data
	1. Nested and ready to be cut out - in blue.
	2. Cut out and assembled - in white.
	3. Flat shapes (at 0,0,0) ready for data extraction - in magenta
* Click on any of the assembled mallet components to see sample details.

* 2015-04-30 ~ This is where things all started
* Loads the WikiHouse DXF file - translated back to R12 format using LibreCAD - and turns the data into 3D
* Click on a mallet component to display basic info in heads-up display at cursor position
