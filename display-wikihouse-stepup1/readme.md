### Build Series
The 'Build' series of files seems to be growing into the specialty of creating new objects that are forks/clones/mini-me's
of the equivalent WikiHouse object directly from user input. In other words, creating WikiHouse Objects via parameterized functions.

[Build WikiHouse StepUp1 R4]( http://wikihouse.github.io/viewer-experiments/display-wikihouse-stepup1/build-wikihouse-stepup1-r4.html )

* Created 2015-05-13 ~ Fully parameterized. Click the sliders to change the overall dimensions
* Lots of minor bugs - that will be fixed in due course


[Build WikiHouse StepUp1 R3]( http://wikihouse.github.io/viewer-experiments/display-wikihouse-stepup1/build-wikihouse-stepup1-r3.html )

* Update 2015-05-10 ~ Every component is a function but most functions are still built using lists of coordinates
* Created 2015-05-08 ~ Work-in-progress toward parameterization


[Build WikiHouse StepUp1 R2]( http://wikihouse.github.io/viewer-experiments/display-wikihouse-stepup1/build-wikihouse-stepup1-r2.html )

* Created 2015-05-05 ~ Work-in-progress toward parameterization

[Build WikiHouse StepUp1 R1]( http://wikihouse.github.io/viewer-experiments/display-wikihouse-stepup1/build-wikihouse-stepup1-r1.html )

* Created 2015-05-04 ~ Work-in-progress toward parameterization

### Display Series
The 'Display' series of files appear to be growing into the specialty of extracting data and measuring data in a variety of manner from the WikiHouse DXF files

These demos reads the StepUp_1.dxf file obtained from the WikiHouse Commons and translate the data into Three.js meshes.
The data is displayed in the browser. Clicking on a mesh toggles its position from unassembled to assemble and back.
Buttons are available to reset all components to start position or to assembled position.
Every time a component is clicked the display notes details regarding the component.

You should be able to rotate, zoom and and pan the structure using your pointing device or one, two and three fingers.


No attempt has been made to create a 'pretty' rendering.
The current focus is on creating a lively and informative presentation of the assembly process.

Currently the assembled position are being input 'by eye' with the help of the limited closest vertex 'snap' point being displayed on screen.
With each new revision, the process should become increasingly automated.

* Created 2015-05-03 ~ Not as flashy. Work-in-progress toward parameterization

* Created 2015-05-02 ~ Dancing even better

~ 2015-05-01 ~ Starting to dance! Yay!

* The DXF file was translated from AutoCAD 2007 DXF back to AutoCAD R12 DXF using LibreCAD.
* A future revision will directly read data in AutoCAD 2007 DXF format.


### Issues
The original data is formulated in millimeters and placed 40 meters along the X axis and 30 meters along the Y axis.
Thus vertex points have numbers such as 39087.905, 28624.0657.
All the components are laid out on a single sheet. No effort has been made to build a block library.
These idiosyncracies are making the automation process more interesting.
