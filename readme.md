2015-05-16 ~ All three viewer projects at a 'good enough' stage to start being viewed by the team

2015-05-03 ~ San Francisco. Hi, my name is Theo Armour. I was introduced to WikiHouse by my daughter [Alix]( http://nimblescooters.com/about-us/ ) and became instantly intrigued.
What I like to do is grab data files that are locked up in hard disks and do my best to help them sing and dance on the web in 3D.
